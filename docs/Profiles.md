# Profiles

## History

This is what we call the version 2 of the profile. We historically had a lightweight profile that inherited from Auth0
profiles (before OIDC-Conformance was added to Auth0) and SCIM profiles.
Profile version 2 aims to be more flexible, standardized, and support all our major use-cases. We expect this profile to
live a long time before it needs to be updated to a new version.

Note that there are few unspecified attribute values, as once they've been presented to a relying party (RP) it is no
longer possible to retire the attribute without potentially breaking the flow for said RP(s).

## Summary

User profiles are represented as JSON objects that follow a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/). The schema contains
descriptions of its fields and is the primary reference for the content of a profile.

When using these schemas, you *should* attempt to fetch the latest version every time (it's fine to cache it for some
period of time, but the schemas may sometimes be updated).

The latest version is available at <https://auth.allizom.org/.well-known/mozilla-iam> (dev) and
<https://auth.mozilla.com/.well-known/mozilla-iam> (prod), look for the `profile_schema_uri` attribute.

### Profile


See [cis_profile](../python-modules/cis_profile/cis_profile/data/profile.schema) for the schema. It contains comments to
indicate what each field is used for.

*IMPORTANT*: The schema validates and enforces correct field attributes such as `display` and `classification`. Passing
schema validation is *required* without any exception.

Note that you may use the `cis_profile` python module as a convenient wrapper to load, validate, create, compare, etc.
user profiles. It can perform signing, verification, validation, scope filtering, etc. steps for you and provide users
as a python class.

### Standard attribute structure

This is the schema that every attribute in the profile **should** follow. Where noted, certain top level attributes may
present a custom list or associative array which contain the standard attribute structure as their ultimate child(s).

The top-level attribute represents the attribute name.

**Rules** to follow when modifying this structure are outlined below:

#### Signature field

The *signature* field is used to certify the attribute has been verified by a publisher, and potentially additional
sources such as users (humans). This allows for performing out-of-band signatures and verifications that the IAM systems
cannot interfere with. No automated IAM system may hold the private signing keys for `additional` signatures.

- JWS and PGP are supported, with various algorithms (see schema for allowed algorithms).
- The publisher signature is always required unless the field value is `null`. The publisher identity is stored in
  `signature.name` and can be mapped to a `kid` in the well-known endpoint.
- The additional signatures may be added by any publisher, and is generally used for user-supplied signatures.
- The data that is signed are the contents of the structure the field `signature` is in, minus the `signature` structure
  itself. E.g. below: `dummy_attribute.*` *minus* `dummy_attribute.signature.*` would be the object to sign.
- The signed object data is serialized by alpha-numerical order (`javascript: JSON.stringify(x)` or `python:
  json.dumps(x, separators=(',',':'))` for example).

To verify a signature, first the `signature.name` is looked up against the publisher names in the well-known endpoint.
Then, the `kid` for that publisher name is extracted and the signature is verified against this `kid`.
If the `signature.name` is incorrect, the wrong `kid` will be extracted and the verification will fail (even if the
signature matches any valid key). This attribute (`signature.name`) is present for performance and human readability
purposes only.

#### Metadata field

The *metadata* field contains additional information about the attribute, which allows the IAM systems to understand
whom may have access to this attribute for example.
- We follow the [Mozilla Data Classification](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Data_Classification) standard for the
  *classification* field.
- The `publisher_authority` is the same publisher identifier as used for the signature fields.
- The `verified` field is set by the `publisher_authority` and represent the fact that **all** values in this object
  have been strongly verified to be correct. For example, an email has been verified to belong to the owner by sending
them an email with a link to verify that they own it. If *any* value is unverified, then the whole object shows as
`verified: false`.
- The `display` field is set by the `publisher_authority` and represent the display intent from the user. For example
  the user may choose to display their name to publicly.


**value** and **values** fields are exclusionary, only one of them may be used.
If used, the *value* field may be of any type: string, boolean, integer, list or associative array value.
If used, the *values* field is of type associative array and may contain any sub-value.

```
"dummy_attribute": {
  "signature": {
    "publisher": { "alg": "HS256", "typ": "jwt", "name": "dummy_access_provider", "value": "dummy signature" },
    "additional": [
      { "alg": "RSA", "typ": "PGP", "name": "dummy user name", "value": "dummy user pgp signature" }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "classification": "PUBLIC",
    "last_modified": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "created": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "verified": true,
    "display": "staff"
  },
  "values": {
    "title": "dummy attribute value",
    "other_title": "another dummy attribute value"
  }
}
```

## Schema Validation

Profiles are validated to comply with the [schemas](../python-modules/cis_profile/cis_profile/data/profile.schema) on
creation and modification. Relying parties (RP) may perform additional validation at their discretion.

## `/userinfo` endpoint and `id_token` responses

User profiles from an OIDC provider's `/userinfo` endpoint may contain additional fields specific to that
provider. RP's should generally not use these fields other than the [OIDC Standard
claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims), preferring the fields described in the
schema as the additional OIDC fields may be access provider specific.

## Profile updates

User profiles are updated by CIS Publishers such as LDAP, HRIS and Mozillians.org by fetching the latest version of a
user profile, performing modifications to fields they are marked as publisher for, and submitting the new version to
CIS.

CIS will revalidate all changes and verify changes have been signed before integrating them in the user profile database
(ID Vault).

### Attribute validation during profile updates

Attributes are updated by CIS Publishers by sending a specifically formatted [Event](cis/docs/Event.md). CIS possesses 
a validation mechanism that enforces which CIS Publisher is allowed to modify which attributes, and which values inside
the said attributes.

# Appendix

## Auth0 specific notes

Auth0 provides [additional documented structure](https://auth0.com/docs/user-profile/normalized) for its profiles. Of
course, using this additional profile information will make the solution specific to Auth0 and are only relevant if the
user profile is collected outside of CIS.

Certain RP may be using the Auth0 management API to fetch user data. This method is deprecated in favor of
[PersonAPI](https://github.com/mozilla-iam/person-api), which is an API interface to CIS.

## Schema generation notes

Schemas are generated by creating a complete (i.e. "all fields") sample user profile, and using the schema generator at
<https://app.quicktype.io/#l=schema>. The resulting schema is then hand-modified and follows the JSON Schema standard.

Finally, the schema syntax is verified, for example at <https://jsonschemalint.com/#/version/draft-06/markup/json> and
normally verified to be compatible with draft-04 at the minimum (this is because most libraries currently support this
draft, even thus newer versions are available).

A YAML-equivalent profile may be generated and verified, for example at <https://json-schema-everywhere.github.io/yaml>

## Profile samples

Note that profiles may be written in YAML instead of JSON, albeit **all** processing will be performed in JSON. This
means all profiles must be converted to JSON before being submitted or used.
